                The features of the basic homepage can be split into two components, roughly speaking. 
                The first of these is the map: when the map loads the user’s location is determined using 
                the Google Geolocation API which is made available to web applications, provided that they 
                are served using HTTPS. The map is then centered on the user’s location and a current location 
                icon is displayed. If the user’s current location is unavailable, then the map is 
                automatically centered on Dublin city center. By default, the map is set to a zoom level where 
                stop icons are visible, and if the user zooms out these icons are gathered together into clusters 
                with the aid of an open source library that was utilised in order to prevent visual cluttering.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Real-Time Tracking of Trips
            </h3>
            <p>
                Whenever a user clicks on a map icon a content window is displayed where real-time information 
                about that stop is promptly presented. In order to obtain the said real-time information, 
                a request is made server-side and the retrieved information is passed to the client (in order 
                to prevent issues with CORS restrictions). A button to save a given stop as a ‘favourite stop’ 
                is available to logged-in users; and favourite stops are displayed with a heart-shaped icon 
                (as opposed to the default generic bus icon), and separated out visually from marker-clusters 
                on the map in order to make it easier and quicker for the user to locate them.
            </p>
            <img class="portfolio-item-img" src="img/search-stop.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                The search bar which we have implemented enables stops to be searched for either by name or by 
                stop ID (the display of this latter kind of detailed information, although seemingly overkill, 
                is in actual fact commonly found on bus-stops). We use a combination of both name and stopID 
                to ensure that the correct bus stop is selected, since many stops have identical names. When 
                a user searches for a particular stop, the map will center on the stop, and the stop’s corresponding 
                content-window will be displayed. Users can also press the ‘Nearest Stop To Me’ button to open 
                the content-window for the stop closest to their current geographical location. If this lattermost 
                data-point is unavailable, then a suitable information message is displayed.

                Route planner
            </h3>
            <p>
                This integral component of the application takes a number of data-inputs from the user, the first two of these being a 
                start and end address respectively. The input boxes for the addresses make use of Google maps 
                ‘Places’ API to autocomplete to specific locations. The user can choose from any of the days 
                available to get a prediction specific to that date. They can moreover select any time they 
                like, although if the combination of the current chosen day and time represents a period in the 
                past, then the time will be automatically changed to the current time (which is the default) 
                and an appropriate error message will be displayed for 10 seconds. Users also have the option 
                to modify the mode of the prediction, which is to say that if they would like to leave the start 
                location at the selected time and date, then they can choose the ‘depart at’ option, otherwise 
                they can choose the ‘arrive by’ option, which allows them to specify the time and date by which 
                they would like to arrive at a given location.
            </p>
            <img class="portfolio-item-img" src="img/2sites.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                The Google ‘Directions’ API is consulted to find the most suitable route (or routes) for a user; 
                once a valid route is returned, a route object is created which contains such information as, 
                for example, the start stop, end stop and lineID. Weather data for the desired date and time is 
                retrieved via a relatively simple database query (a database is used to store this information to 
                prevent issues of too many concurrent users making API requests to a third party distributor), and 
                the relevant route object and weather information are then promptly forwarded as inputs to our 
                predictive model. The results of backend data processing are displayed in a collapsible section 
                underneath the route planner form. This collapsible section contains all pertinent route information, 
                a predicted journey duration, the option to display the route on the map, as well as a button to 
                save the trip for future reference.

            <h3>
                Saving favourite locations
            </h3>
            <p>
                Users also avail of the further possibility to save favourite locations in order to access them 
                more quickly at a later stage. Both a short name and a full address must be provided for the use 
                of this particular feature, and the relevant information is subsequently stored in our database. 
                When a user clicks on any one of their saved locations, the corresponding address will automatically 
                be filled in the first empty address input box, so that the user does not have to manually search 
                for an address.
            </p>
            <img class="portfolio-item-img" src="img/save-stop.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                whenever (logged-in) users make use of the route planning tool, they have the further option to 
                save a trip. This allows us to store the route object containing all the stops associated with 
                that trip in our database so that the user can access it at a later stage. But this is not all: 
                when the user comes close to the start stop of their planned journey, they have the ability to 
                click a button which 'starts the trip' as it were. All the stops associated with that trip are 
                then displayed for the user's convenience. Moreover, we also display the number of stops and the 
                distance until the user's final destination, and these data-points are continuously updated as 
                the user progresses along his/her route. The coordinate shape of the route is plotted on the map 
                and the user's position on the route is marked and updated as he/she moves. When the user starts 
                his/her trip we begin location-tracking, a technique which allows us to calculate the distance 
                the user is from each given stop in real time, while updating all the relevant information that 
                is displayed as the user approaches each subsequent stop. The stops on display only ever include 
                remaining stops on the route and both distance and the number of stops until the destination are 
                dynamically updated at each step of the journey. Most importantly, however, predictive times are 
                repeatedly computed at regular intervals during the course of the journey so as to give the user 
                an accurate estimate of remaining travel time. This final feature of the application allowed us 
                to provide users with the most complete information possible whilst also making the application 
                a little bit more interactive.

                Clustering of Stops for Efficient Location-Based Searching
            </h3>
            <p>
                In order to improve the efficiency of this process, we used DBSCAN clustering, an algorithmic 
                method that “groups together points based on distance”[1]. In essence, the stops were first grouped 
                into 38 clusters based on their distance from one another (less than 0.8 km). This meant that 
                we could then compute the cluster whose centermost stop was the least distance from any given 
                user’s current location, and then use the coordinates of this centermost stop as a key into the 
                specific cluster which contained the nearest stop to the user. This technique reduced overall 
                search time significantly.
